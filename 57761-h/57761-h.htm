<p class='c013'>This abridged history of the Regiment has been
prepared by certain members of the History Committee,
and edited by the Chairman.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Chairman (Lieut.-General Sir Edward Hutton)
is indebted to the following members of the Regimental
History Committee:—Major-General Astley Terry,
Major the Hon. C. Sackville-West, Captain Hereward
Wake, and also to Colonel Horatio Mends for the contribution,
wholly or in part, of Part I, Sec. 3; Part II,
Secs. 4 and 5; Part III, Secs. 9 and 10; and Part III,
Secs. 7 and 8 respectively.</p>

<p class='c014'>The existing short history, written by Major-General
Astley Terry and Colonel Mends and published with
the Standing Orders of the Regiment, has been taken
as a basis.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been the object of the compilers, while
amplifying the short history, to form a Prelude to
the large and comprehensive History of the Regiment
by Captain Lewis Butler, the publication of which—from
the difficulties to be overcome, the researches
to be made, and the immense mass of detail to be dissected—must
necessarily be further delayed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every effort has been made to narrate in a concise
and popular form the origin, history, and world-wide
services of the several battalions, so that every Rifleman
may be able to learn at least the outlines of the
history of his Regiment—a Corps whose battle honours
are unequalled in number, and whose reputation for
discipline and courage is unsurpassed in the annals of
the British Army.</p>

<p class='c014'>The gallant exploits of the Regiment are here given
in no spirit of pride or self-adulation, but with the
earnest hope that, profiting by the example of their
predecessors, the present and future generations of
Riflemen may not only successfully maintain as a
sacred trust the credit and renown of The King’s
Royal Rifle Corps, but may also still further add to
the honours and reputation already won.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Regiment was raised during 1755–56 in North
America under special conditions, for the express
purpose of assisting our Army to retrieve the terrible
disaster which had befallen the British troops under
<em>General Braddock</em> at the hands of a smaller force of
French and Red Indians in the forest fastnesses upon
the banks of the Ohio River. It had been found that
the slow and ponderous movements of troops trained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>upon the European model, with their heavy accoutrements,
tight uniforms, and unsuitable tactics, were
helpless against savages, and almost equally helpless
against soldiers habituated to wars in the dense forests
and trackless wastes of America. It was therefore
decided by the British Government to raise in America,
from amongst the Colonists themselves, a force which
should be able to meet these conditions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>60th ROYAL AMERICANS.</div>

<p class='c014'>Designated as the 62nd, and the following year
as the 60th Royal Americans, the Regiment was
accordingly formed of 4,000 men in four battalions,
and General the Earl of Loudoun, Commander-in-Chief
of the British Army in America, was appointed Colonel-in-Chief.
It was recruited from settlers, mainly of
German and Swiss origin, in the States of Massachusetts,
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina,
to which were added volunteers from British regiments
and others. Many of the senior officers and a considerable
number of the Company officers were drawn from
the armies of Europe, some of them being highly trained
and experienced soldiers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Through the bold initiative of Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry Bouquet,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> a Swiss officer of distinction, commanding
the 1st Battalion, the 60th Royal Americans
adopted Colonial methods of equipment, simpler drill,
open formations, and the Indian system of forest
warfare, thus early acquiring those attributes of
individual action, swift initiative, and of elastic though
firm discipline, which have been the conspicuous characteristics
of the Regiment throughout its long and
brilliant career, characteristics which have made its
reputation. Thus equipped, The Royal American Regiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>from its very beginning played a distinguished and
memorable part in establishing British power in North
America.</p>

<p class='c014'>The great struggle between France and England
for supremacy in America was at its height, when
early in 1758, Abercromby,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> who had succeeded
Loudoun as Commander-in-Chief, decided upon a
general advance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>July 8th, 1758, TICONDEROGA.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 1st and 4th Battalions, under Bouquet and
Haldimand,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> formed part of the main Army in the
Western Field of operations, and on the banks of Lake
Champlain, at the memorable defeat of Ticonderoga,
“at once a glory and a shame,” the 4th Battalion
and a portion of the 1st showed a stubborn courage
worthy of the highest praise, and lost very heavily
in killed and wounded. On July the 27th, three weeks
later, regardless of their losses, the Regiment furnished
a part of the column under Bradstreet,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> of the 60th,
which, after a forced march, captured by a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>
Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nov. 25th, 1758, Capture of FORT DUQUESNE.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 1st Battalion, employed on the Western frontiers
under <em>General Forbes</em>, played the leading part in the
advance against Fort Duquesne on the Ohio, in November,
1758, and led by the gallant Bouquet effected
its capture from the French and Red Indians.
This brilliant triumph over great physical difficulties
was achieved by sheer determination, endurance, and
pluck; and the solid value of the victory is thus
summed up by the American historian, Parkman:—“It
opened the great West to English enterprise, took
from France half her savage allies, and relieved her
Western borders from the scourge of Indian Wars.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Fort Duquesne, re-christened Fort Pitt, was thereupon
garrisoned by a detachment of the 60th, and was
destined later to play a prominent part in the subsequent
operations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>July 26th, 1758, LOUISBURG.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 2nd and 3rd Battalions, under Lieut.-Colonel
Young and Major Augustine Prevost<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> respectively,
early in 1758 were ordered to join Generals Amherst<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
and <em>Wolfe</em> in the Eastern Field of operations, and they
took a prominent part in the capture of <span class='sc'>Louisburg</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sept. 13th, 1759, QUEBEC.</div>

<p class='c014'>These two Battalions were subsequently in 1759
moved up the St. Lawrence to Quebec, where they
still further distinguished themselves at Montmorency
Falls, below Quebec, on July the 31st, and by their rapid
movements and their intrepid courage won from <em>General
Wolfe</em> the motto of “Celer et Audax” (Swift and Bold).
A still greater opportunity occurred on the 13th of
September at the decisive battle of <span class='sc'>Quebec</span>, where
upon the Plains of Abraham the 2nd Battalion, whose
Grenadier Company had been the first to scale the
heights, covered the left during the battle against a
very superior force of Red Indians and French, who
made the most determined efforts to assail the flank
and rear of <em>Wolfe’s</em> army under cover of the dense
bush and rocky ground.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The 60th thus lost heavily in
killed and wounded. The 3rd Battalion played a no
less important part by holding in check the enemy,
who threatened the rear through the thick woods on
the river banks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1760, MONTREAL.</div>

<p class='c014'>Amherst, who in 1759 had succeeded Abercromby
in chief command of the Army, led the main force
in its advance to Montreal, where, on the 8th of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>September, 1760, the 4th Battalion, a portion of the
1st, and the Grenadiers of the 2nd and 3rd, shared in
the glories of the surrender of the French Army under
the Marquis de Vaudreuil—a surrender through which
the supremacy in America finally passed to the British
Crown.</p>

<p class='c014'>Following up their successes in 1758, under <em>Forbes</em>,
Bouquet and the 1st Battalion had by degrees captured
or occupied the whole of the French posts west of
the Alleghany Mountains, and they were accordingly
chosen for the arduous task of defending the various
forts established in the unexplored country south of
the great lakes. A region embracing thousands of
miles of surface was thus consigned to the keeping
of five or six hundred men—a vast responsibility for
a single weak Battalion garrisoning a few insignificant
forts.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1763 took place the general and sudden rising
of the Indians under Pontiac—a formidable conspiracy,
bringing ruin and desolation to the settlers in those
wild regions, and even threatening the safety of the
Colonies. By surprise or stratagem the Indians, in
overwhelming numbers, secured many of the widely
scattered posts held by the 60th, murdering some of
the slender garrisons and beleaguering others. But
the important posts of Fort Detroit upon the Straits
joining Lake Erie and Lake Huron, and of Fort Pitt
commanding the Ohio River valley, both garrisoned
by the 60th under Gladwyn and Ecuyer respectively,
were gallantly and successfully held against tremendous
odds. The relief of these two important posts were
operations of the greatest urgency, and every effort
was made to get sufficient troops for this purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aug. 5th and 6th, 1763. BUSHEY RUN.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Nov. 15th, 1764, RED INDIAN CAMPAIGN.</div>

<p class='c014'>It was at once decided that Fort Pitt on the Ohio,
guarding as it did the Western frontier of the Colonies,
must be saved at any cost, but owing to the reduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of the Army in America after the great war, it was with
the utmost difficulty that, at Carlisle, 150 miles west
of Philadelphia, a small column was formed under
Bouquet, consisting of barely 500 men of the 1st Battalion
60th Royal Americans and the 42nd Highlanders.
This courageous band, led by the stout-hearted and
experienced Henry Bouquet, marched almost as a forlorn
hope to the relief of the garrison. Reaching,
after a long and weary march, the dangerous defiles
of Bushey Run, ten miles only from their objective
and within view of the scene of Braddock’s crushing
defeat, a site of battle deliberately chosen by their
cunning foe, the little force was suddenly attacked by
a vastly superior number of Indian braves. During two
long trying days the combatants fought a desperate
battle, until at last Bouquet’s genius as a leader
achieved a brilliant victory. This victory, pronounced
by an American historian “the best contested action
ever fought between white men and Indians,” was
followed up in the coming year by a vigorous advance
by Bradstreet upon Detroit by way of Lake Erie; and by
Bouquet marching from Fort Pitt with a column consisting
of his own Battalion of the 60th, the 42nd, and
Provincial troops, which he led into the very heart of
the enemy’s country. Bouquet’s column was triumphant,
and upon reaching the Indian settlements on the
River Muskingum, deep in the wild fastnesses of the
primeval forest, their leader’s diplomatic skill and
defiant attitude completed the successful issue of the
campaign. Bouquet thus rightly earned for himself and
his men the credit of having finally broken the French
influence and Red Indian power in the West, giving to
the British Crown all the vast territories west of the
Alleghany Mountains and south of the Great Lakes,
comprising now the States of Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Western Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan,
and Illinois.</p>

<p class='c014'>The conspicuous part played at this period by the
60th Royal Americans, and the exceptional merit of
many of its officers have hitherto been better understood
in the United States and in Canada than by our
own countrymen. But it is now at last acknowledged
that the Regiment, owing to its especial attributes,
was in the forefront of all those operations which
(more than any others) added a peculiar lustre to the
British Crown at this early stage of the evolution of
the British Empire in North America. There is no
period in the Regimental history of which The King’s
Royal Rifle Corps may more justly be proud than the
epoch from its birth in 1755 to the final overthrow
of the French and Red-Indian power in 1764.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile, in February, 1762, the 3rd Battalion,
moving to the West Indies, had taken part in the capture
of <span class='sc'>Martinique</span>. It subsequently joined the expedition
to Cuba under the <em>Earl of Albemarle</em>, where, led by
Brigadier-General Haviland,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> it played a leading part
in the capture of <span class='sc'>Havannah</span> from the Spaniards on

<p class='c014'>On the termination of the French War in America
the British Army was reduced, and in 1764 and 1763
respectively the 3rd and 4th Battalions were disbanded.</p>

<p class='c014'>The discontented and hostile feeling of the American
Colonies at this period rendered it advisable to transfer
The Royal Americans to the West Indies, recruited
as they were from the Colonists themselves. Thus it
fell to the lot of the Regiment to take a prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>share in the conquest and annexation of the West
Indian Islands and the adjacent coast, which took
place at this period. The officers in many instances
filled important posts as Governors and Administrators
of the various islands.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the outbreak of the War of Independence in
1775 the 3rd and 4th Battalions were again raised
in England and despatched to the West Indies, and
thence to Florida, where they figured prominently in the
operations in that region.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1779, SAVANNAH.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>AMERICAN WAR.</div>

<p class='c014'>In 1779 the 3rd and some companies of the 4th
Battalion formed portion of an army under General
Augustine Prevost in Georgia and South Carolina. The
Regiment played a leading part at the brilliant action of
Briars Creek (March 3rd, 1779), and also in the subsequent
siege of Savannah, where a superior force of
French and Americans under Comte d’Estaigne and
General Lincoln was successfully held at bay by a
very much smaller army under Prevost, and at the
final assault was signally defeated with great loss
(October the 9th, 1779). An improvised body of Light
Dragoons (or Mounted Infantry), organised by Lieut.-Colonel
Marc Prevost,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of the 60th, did remarkable
service during these operations, and at the victory on
the 9th of October lost heavily, but greatly distinguished
itself by repulsing the main column of the enemy
and capturing the colour of the Carolina Regiment,
now in the possession of the Prevost family.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the termination of the American War of
Independence in 1783 the 3rd and 4th Battalions were
disbanded for the second time, but were again raised
in 1788 and despatched to the West Indies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>WEST INDIES.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Regiment, for the most part quartered in the

Lieutenant-Colonel Baron de Rottenburg,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> upon the
German model as a Special Corps of Riflemen. Four
hundred of Hompesch’s Mounted Riflemen—a German
Corps raised for service under the British Crown—were
drafted into the Battalion, which was armed with
rifles and dressed in green with red facings. The
second Lieutenant-Colonel was that celebrated Robert
Crauford, who afterwards made his name so famous
in the Peninsular War as the honoured leader of the
Light Division. Thus, by the addition of the 5th
Battalion to the Regiment as Riflemen in 1797, the
gradual evolution of the 60th Royal Americans into
The King’s Royal Rifle Corps was auspiciously begun.</p>

<p class='c018'>In 1808 Great Britain determined to take the

endeavour to drive Napoleon and the French from the
Peninsula of Spain and Portugal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aug. 21st, 1808, VIMIERA.</div>

<p class='c014'>Thus began the Peninsular War, so full of glorious
memories for the British Army. The 5th Battalion,
under the command of Major Davy,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> formed part of
the force despatched under <em>Sir Arthur Wellesley</em> to
Portugal, and in conjunction with the 2nd Battalion
of the 95th<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> opened the campaign at Obidos on the 15th
of August; and two days later took part in the fight of
<span class='sc'>Roleia</span>. The services of the Battalion as Light Troops
or Riflemen were valued so highly by the Commander
of the forces, and so important was their example, that
in a very complimentary order he directed its distribution
by companies among the several brigades of the
army. Thus it came to be engaged in nearly all the
great battles throughout the war, starting brilliantly
with the battle of <span class='sc'>Vimiera</span>,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> where a signal victory
was gained over the French under General Junot.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><em>Wellesley</em> was shortly afterwards superseded by Sir
Harry Burrard<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and <em>Sir Hew Dalrymple</em>, who ended
the campaign by the Convention of Cintra, under the
terms of which the French evacuated Portugal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jan. 16th, 1809, CORUNNA.</div>

<p class='c014'>The three commanders were then ordered home,
and Sir John Moore<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> assumed charge of the troops.
<em>Sir David Baird</em> landed at Corunna with reinforcements,
including the 2nd Battalion, and on the 20th of December
he joined Moore near Mayorga. By the masterly
dispositions of Napoleon himself, an overwhelming force
of French was concentrated under Soult, and this forced
the British to retire on Corunna. Soult, following in
pursuit, attacked them in the act of embarking, but
met with a crushing defeat. The British, however,
paid a high price for their victory: <em>Baird</em> was severely
wounded, and the gallant Sir John Moore was killed—his
death being a heavy loss to the British Army. At
this juncture General Hope<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> took over the command
and completed the embarkation of the troops. The
Regiment, having been allotted to the defence of the
town of Corunna, was not actually engaged in the
battle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>July 27th and 28th, 1809, TALAVERA.</div>

<p class='c014'>In 1809 <em>Wellesley</em>, for the second time, landed in
Portugal and assumed command. After some delay,
on May the 12th he forced the passage of the Douro
in the face of a large army under Soult, a most brilliant
feat of arms. On the 27th and 28th of July he attacked
the French and Marshals Jourdan and Victor, under
King Joseph, and thereupon ensued the great British
victory of <span class='sc'>Talavera</span>. “Upon this occasion,” wrote
<em>Sir Arthur Wellesley</em> in his despatch, “the steadiness

this time commanded by Colonel Williams<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a>), being
specially noted by <em>General Picton</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yielding to superior numbers and to stress of
circumstances, <em>Wellington</em> retreated, and, falling back
upon the famous lines of Torres Vedras, was closely
followed by the French, who, on being stopped by
the fortifications and unable to procure supplies, were
soon forced in turn to retreat.</p>

<p class='c014'>In March, 1811, the British again advanced, driving

Casal Nova and Sabugal. While following up his
successes, <em>Wellington</em> was attacked by Massena at
<span class='sc'>Fuentes D’Onor</span>, on the 3rd of May, and again on the
5th, but he held his ground in spite of severe fighting.
In the meanwhile Marshal Beresford,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> who had four
companies of the 60th with his division, had in April
taken Olivenza, and on the 16th of May had defeated
Soult at <span class='sc'>Albuhera</span>; and the campaign of 1811 was
brought to a close by the brilliant action of Arroyo
dos Molinos by <em>General Hill</em> on October the 28th, 1811,
when the Regiment specially distinguished itself.</p>

afterwards ensued the successful siege of <span class='sc'>Badajoz</span>.
Sending <em>Hill</em> to destroy the bridge of Almarez,
<em>Wellington</em> proceeded northwards, and on the 22nd of
July defeated Marmont at the battle of <span class='sc'>Salamanca</span>,
the crowning feat of a long series of brilliant manœuvres.
The English General thereupon marched towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Madrid, and, driving King Joseph before him, entered
the capital in triumph on the 12th of August. But

<p class='c014'>In May, 1813, the Army finally quitted Portugal,
and again advancing drove the French northwards by
brilliant strategy. On the 21st of June <em>Wellington</em>
gained a splendid victory over King Joseph at
<span class='sc'>Vittoria</span>, capturing 150 guns and his whole transport.
The companies of the Regiment with <em>Picton</em> and the
3rd Division played an especially brilliant part.
Ignominiously driven from Spain the French Army
rallied on the Bidassoa, where Soult assumed command,
having been despatched by Napoleon to supersede his
brother King Joseph and Marshal Jourdan. He immediately
attacked the English, but was defeated with
great slaughter at the battle of the <span class='sc'>Pyrenees</span>, which
lasted eight days, July the 24th to August the 2nd.
The 5th Battalion was at this time commanded by
Major Fitzgerald.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> <em>Wellington</em>, then advancing into
France, forced the passage of the Bidassoa on
October the 7th, and defeated the French at the battle
of <span class='sc'>Nivelle</span>, terminating the campaign by a victory
on the <span class='sc'>Nive</span> after a battle lasting five days.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Feb. 27th, 1814, ORTHES.</div>

<p class='c014'>In February, 1814, occurred one of the most brilliant
manœuvres of the war—the famous passage of the
Adour, which was forced in the teeth of a Division
of the French Army, the company of the 60th leading
the advance of the Guards’ Brigade, to which it was
attached. On the 27th of the same month Soult was
again totally defeated at <span class='sc'>Orthes</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>April 10th, 1814, TOULOUSE.</div>

<p class='c014'><em>Wellington</em>, following up this victory, advanced on
Toulouse, where, on the 10th of April, the British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>troops won the last of the fourteen great battles
fought in the Peninsular War, in twelve of which the
Regiment had taken a glorious part. The repulse of
a sortie from Bayonne was the final episode of this
memorable war.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus closes a momentous record of gallant achievements
of the Regiment. Among the officers of the
5th Battalion who distinguished themselves during the
Peninsular War, besides those already mentioned, were
Major Woodgate,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Lieutenant-Colonel Galiffe,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Captain
Schoedde,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> and Captain de Blacquière.</p>

<p class='c014'>To continue the history of the other Battalions
of the Regiment at this period, the 2nd Battalion,
in January, 1809, after Corunna, had returned to the
Channel Islands, and thence to the West Indies. The
1st Battalion, which had previously always been
quartered in America, was in 1810, together with the
4th Battalion, brought to England, whence it shortly
afterwards proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope, and
the 4th Battalion was sent to Dominica.</p>

<p class='c014'>A 7th and 8th Battalion were added in 1813, the
former raised at Gibraltar and the latter at Lisbon.
Both battalions were dressed in green, which colour
at the end of 1815 was adopted for the whole Regiment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1824, 60th ROYAL AMERICANS become 60th THE DUKE OF YORK’S OWN RIFLE CORPS.</div>

<p class='c014'>At the conclusion of the war with France the Regiment
was reduced to two battalions, of which the 1st
was called “The Rifles,” and the 2nd “The Light
Infantry” Battalion. In 1824 the 2nd Battalion became
also a Rifle Battalion, and the Regiment dropping
its old title of “Royal Americans” was granted by
George IV the name of “The Duke of York’s Own
Rifle Corps,” dated June 4th.</p>

H.R.H. the Duke of York,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> who had been Colonel-in-Chief

In 1830 the title of the Regiment, by order of William
IV, was again changed to The King’s Royal Rifle Corps.</p>

<p class='c014'>A long peace followed the great wars of the
Napoleonic period, and from Toulouse in 1814 until
the Sikh War in 1848 the Regiment was not engaged
on active service. But from 1848 onwards the British
Army entered upon a famous series of campaigns, in
nearly all of which the Regiment has taken a memorable
share. Its success may be said to be largely due
to the excellence and the example of the 1st Battalion,
which—directly inheriting the Peninsular
honours and traditions of the 5th Battalion as
Riflemen—had maintained, in spite of the long peace,
its reputation for smartness, discipline, and warlike
efficiency.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Fortunate at this period in many officers of great
experience, the Regiment owed much to Lieutenant-Colonel
the Hon. Henry Richard Molyneux,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> who
commanded the 1st Battalion (then quartered in the
Mediterranean) from 1836 until his untimely death in

under his successor Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon.
Henry Dundas,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> were largely due to his strong
personality and to his powers of organisation. Dundas
commanded the Battalion from 1845 to 1854 with
conspicuous success. In the Sikh War, both as Colonel
and as Brigadier-General, he showed the highest
qualities of leadership and courage, and throughout
the nine years of his command the Battalion held
a foremost place in the British Army in India.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1848–49, PUNJAUB.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Jan. 22nd, 1849, MOOLTAN.</div>

<p class='c014'>It was thus under these favourable circumstances
that the Regiment began its career in the East, and
under Dundas played a prominent part in the Sikh
War. Employed in covering the advance, it rendered
conspicuous service at the storming of the city of
<span class='sc'>Mooltan</span>. “Nothing could exceed the gallantry and

the <cite>Gazette</cite>, 7th of March, 1849.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Feb. 21st, 1849, GOOJERAT.</div>

<p class='c014'>Subsequently, by forced marches, the Battalion
joined the army under Lord Gough<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> in time to share
in the final battle of <span class='sc'>Goojerat</span>, a victory over a combined
force of 60,000 Sikhs and Afghans. The result
of this triumph of British arms was the annexation of
the Punjaub, and the retreat of the Ameer Dost
Mahomed Khan with the Afghan army beyond the
Khyber Pass.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the 8th of July, 1850, H.R.H. Adolphus Duke
of Cambridge died, and was succeeded as Colonel-in-Chief
by Field-Marshal H.R.H. Prince Albert, Consort
of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1851–2–3, SOUTH AFRICA.</div>

<p class='c014'>In 1851 the 2nd Battalion, which had been on
home service since 1847, embarked for South Africa,
and was employed in the Kaffir War during that and
the two following years. It took part under Lieut.-Colonel
Nesbitt in many actions with the enemy,
including the passage of the Great Kei, the operations
for clearing the Water Kloof, and the attack on the
Iron Mountain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Feb. 26th, 1852, WRECK OF THE ‘BIRKENHEAD.’</div>

<p class='c014'>A detachment of the 2nd Battalion (forty-one all
ranks, with seven women and thirteen children)
formed a portion of the troops on board the ill-fated
troopship <em>Birkenhead</em>, which, on the night of February
the 26th, 1852, was wrecked on the South African
coast under conditions which evoked from the troops
on board a memorable display of steady discipline
and serene courage in the face of danger. The men
fell in and stood calmly on parade awaiting death
while the ship was sinking “without a cry or murmur
among them.” The whole ship’s company with few
exceptions perished.</p>

<p class='c014'>On September the 23rd, 1852, General Viscount
Beresford became Colonel-in-Chief, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice</span></i> H.R.H. Prince
Albert, and was upon his death on the 28th of January,
1854, succeeded by Field-Marshal Viscount Gough.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1855 and 1857 the 3rd and 4th Battalions were
raised at Dublin and at Winchester respectively. Thus
in 1857 the Regiment again consisted of four
Battalions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The outbreak of the Great Mutiny of the Native
Army in India began on the 10th of May, 1857, at
Meerut, where the 1st Battalion was at that time
quartered under the command of Lieut.-Colonel John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Jones.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The Battalion at the moment was mustering
for evening church parade. On hearing the news it
immediately fell in, and Captain Muter,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> the senior officer
present, with great promptitude instantly despatched
a company to secure the Treasury. The Battalion
thereupon marched towards the city, when being joined
by the 6th Carabiniers and a Battery of Horse Artillery
(all the European troops available), it proceeded to
occupy the lines of the Native troops, thus effectually
preventing the mutineers from establishing themselves
in the city, so that they were forced forthwith to retreat
towards Delhi. The story is told that while hurrying to
the native lines the Battalion came upon the body of a
lady lying dead and mutilated by the roadside. This
lady was well known both to the officers and men
for her devotion and care for the women and children
of the Battalion, and the men as they passed—exasperated
at the sight—raised their rifles in the
air and swore to avenge her death. It is not too
much to say that the Battalion, and their leader known
later as “Jones the Avenger,” made good their oath.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>May 30th and 31st, 1857, HINDUN.</div>

<p class='c014'>Marching in pursuit, under <em>Brigadier Archdale
Wilson</em>, the Meerut troops fought two successful
actions upon the Hindun River, in which the 1st
Battalion took a prominent part, and on the 7th of
June it joined the army under <em>Major-General Sir Henry
Barnard</em> at Alighur.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>June 8th to Sept. 20th, 1857, DELHI.</div>

<p class='c014'>At one o’clock on the following morning the whole
of <em>Barnard’s</em> force moved against Delhi. On reaching
Badlee-ke-Serai it was found that the mutineers were
strongly posted in an entrenched position along the ridge
from the flagstaff to Hindoo Rao’s house, overlooking
the cantonments and city, but after a sharp engagement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of about three quarters of an hour the ridge
was cleared of the enemy and occupied by our troops.
Thus began the famous siege of <span class='sc'>Delhi</span>—a period full
of glorious memories to all Sixtieth Riflemen. From
then on to the final assault on the city (June the 8th
to September the 20th) the Battalion was constantly
employed either as outposts near Hindoo Rao’s house,
or with the various columns which were sent forward
to drive the mutineers back into the city, when,
emboldened by the strength of overwhelming numbers,
they made repeated assaults upon our position on the
ridge. It is recorded that the Regiment was during
this period engaged in twenty-four separate actions.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the morning of September the 14th, after six
days of bombardment, two breaches were considered
practicable in the walls of the city, one in the curtain
to the right of the Cashmere Gate, the other to the
left of the water bastion. The assault was delivered
at three points, namely upon the two breaches and
the Cashmere Gate, while a fourth column followed
as reserve. The whole of the Battalion was split up
in skirmishing order to cover the advance of the assaulting
columns, and in this appropriate and congenial duty
they greatly distinguished themselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>The assaults were successful, and after an heroic
struggle the city was partially occupied by night-fall.
But it was not until September the 20th that the
place and its defences were completely in the hands
of our troops, and then only after continuous and
desperate hand to hand fighting in the streets. Nothing
could exceed the determined valour of the Regiment,
and every Rifleman will remember with justifiable pride
and pleasure that, having joined the army before Delhi,
its services were officially pronounced to be “preeminent
in the memorable siege and capture.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“All behaved nobly,” writes Lord Canning, the
Governor-General of India in his final despatch upon
the siege and capture of Delhi (dated November the
9th, 1857), “but I may be permitted to allude
somewhat to those Corps most constantly engaged
from the beginning, the 60th Rifles, the Sirmoor
Battalion,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> and the Guides. Probably not one day
throughout the siege passed without a casualty in
one of these Corps; placed in the very front of our
position, they were ever under fire. Their courage,
their high qualifications as skirmishers, their cheerfulness,
their steadiness were beyond commendation.
Their losses in action show the nature of the service.
The Rifles commenced with 440 of all ranks; a few
days before the storm they received a reinforcement
of nearly 200 men; their total casualties were 389.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We may conclude this page of the Regiment’s
history by citing the judgment of the General under
whom they served, who described the Battalion as
“a glorious example both in its daring gallantry and
its perfect discipline.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>1858, ROHILKUND OUDH.</div>

<p class='c014'>In the following year the 1st Battalion formed part
of the Roorkee Field Force under Jones, now promoted
Brigadier-General, which operated against the rebels
from the 11th of April until the 24th of May, 1858.</p>

<p class='c014'>During this short campaign Jones’ force swept
through the whole Province of Rohilkund from north
to south; fought one battle (Nugeenah, 21st of April);
defeated the enemy in three actions (Bagawalla, 17th
of April, Dojura, and Bareilly, 3rd of May); assaulted
and captured one city (Bareilly, 6th of May); and
relieved two others (Moradabad, 18th of April, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Shahjehanpore, 11th of May); destroyed two forts
(Bunnai, 24th of May, and Mahomdee, 25th of May);
and took thirty-seven guns. It was said of the gallant
Jones that “he never assaulted a position that he did
not take, nor attacked a gun that he did not capture.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The 1st Battalion again took part in operations
in Oudh, under Brigadier <em>Sir Thomas Seaton</em> and
<em>Brigadier Colin Troup</em>, from the 8th of October until
the 31st of December, 1858. Four successful actions
were fought with the rebels (Bunkagaon, 8th of
October; Pusgaon, 19th of October; Rissoolpur, 25th
of October; and Baragoan, 23rd of November); and
the Fort of Mittowlis captured (10th of November);
thence the Battalion formed part of a flying column,
which cleared the rebels out of the Khyreeghur jungles.</p>

<p class='c014'>A wing of the 2nd Battalion, which had been
ordered from the Cape, also took part in the final stages
of the operations against the mutineers.</p>

<p class='c014'>In March, 1860, the 1st Battalion embarked for
England, and in a General Order Lord Canning,
Governor-General of India, bore further testimony to the
services of the Battalion in eloquent and unprecedented
terms, concluding with the following memorable tribute:</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is not more by the valour of its officers and
men, conspicuous as that has been on every occasion,
than by the discipline and excellent conduct of all ranks
during the whole of their service in India, that this Regiment
has distinguished itself. The Governor-General
tenders to the Battalion his warmest acknowledgments
for the high example it has set in every respect to the troops
with which it has been associated in quarters as well as
in the field; and he assures its officers and men that
the estimation in which their services are held by
the Government of India confirms to the full the respect
and admiration with which they are universally regarded.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The splendid services rendered by the Regiment
in the period in its history above briefly recorded may
perhaps be equalled, but can hardly be surpassed by
future generations of Riflemen. The good conduct,
sound discipline, and unflinching courage of the 1st
Battalion during its service in India (1845–1860) will
always be regarded by the Regiment as marking a
Golden Age in its history and a landmark in its
traditions.</p>

under Lieutenant-Colonel Palmer,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a> embarked at
Calcutta to join the Franco-British Expedition to
China under <em>General Sir Hope Grant</em>. Six months
later the Battalion took a vigorous part in the assault
and capture of the <span class='sc'>Taku Forts</span> on the Peiho River
(August the 21st), and thence marched to and occupied
<span class='sc'>Pekin</span> on the 13th of September.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1861, TRENT AFFAIR.</div>

<p class='c014'>In 1861 the 4th Battalion was hurriedly despatched
to Canada at the time of the Trent affair, when war
with the Northern States of America seemed imminent,
and Fenian raids were threatened. This Battalion—commanded
for fourteen years (1860–1873) by
Lieutenant-Colonel Hawley,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> an officer of commanding
personality and ability—achieved at this period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and later the highest reputation for its system of light
drill and of organisation then far in advance of the
age, a system which has gradually been adopted by
the whole Army. The Regiment, both individually
and collectively, is deeply indebted to Hawley. Sir
Redvers Buller<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> and Lord Grenfell<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a> owed their early
training to his tuition; and there are few Riflemen of our
generation who have achieved distinction who do not
directly or indirectly owe their success to his inspiration
and teaching, and his influence is still generally
acknowledged in the Regiment to-day.</p>

<p class='c014'>In 1869 the 4th Battalion returned to England,
and was quartered at Aldershot, where its high state
of efficiency was universally acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the death of Lord Gough, on the 3rd of March,
1869, Field-Marshal H.R.H. George Duke of Cambridge,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, was
appointed Colonel-in-Chief.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1870, RED RIVER EXPEDITION.</div>

<p class='c014'>In 1867 the 1st Battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Feilden,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a> was moved from the Mediterranean to Canada,
and on the outbreak of Riel’s Rebellion in 1870 was
selected by <em>Colonel Wolseley</em><a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> to take part in the Red
River Expedition. The force, numbering 1200, consisted
of two guns, R.A., the 1st Battalion 60th Rifles,
and two specially raised battalions of Canadian Militia.
After a journey of 600 miles by land and lake, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>reached Thunder Bay, on Lake Superior. Leaving
Lake Shebandowah, fifty miles from Lake Superior,
on the 16th of July, the Expedition then traversed
in boats 600 miles of a region of rivers, lakes,
and forest, practically unexplored and trackless, and
after six weeks of incessant toil, on the 24th of August
reached Fort Garry (now the city of Winnipeg), the
headquarters of the rebel forces under Louis Riel.
<em>Wolseley</em>, by a brilliant <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>, pushed on with
the 1st Battalion in fifty boats, and took Riel and
his followers completely by surprise. Hurriedly the
insurgent leader abandoned Fort Garry, and the
rebellion collapsed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The direct effect of this achievement, in which the
Regiment was fortunate enough to take so prominent
and decisive a share, has been the unification of the
Dominion of Canada and the opening up to a great
and prosperous future of the whole wide region of the
great North-west, destined to become one of the most
populous and most important portions of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus for a second time has the 1st Battalion of the
Regiment been privileged to play a direct and almost
single-handed part in the addition of vast regions to
the British Crown in North America: first, in 1758–1764,
under Bouquet, in conquering those territories west of
the Alleghany Mountains, now some of the most prosperous
States of the American Union; and, second, in
1870, under <em>Wolseley</em>, in crushing a rebellion, the overthrow
of which has enabled the prairies of the North-west
Territories of Canada to be welded into what are
now among the most flourishing Provinces of the
Dominion.</p>

<p class='c018'>The overwhelming defeat of the French Armies by
the German troops in the momentous war of 1870–71
brought about vast changes in military Europe. A
system of compulsory service on the German model
was introduced by all the great nations of Europe—Great
Britain excepted—and German drill, German
style of uniform, and German methods were generally
adopted.</p>

<p class='c014'>In England a strong wave of pro-German feeling
swept over the British Army, and military critics
advocated the methodical system of the German Army
with its stern unbending discipline and exacting method
of machine-like <em>collectivism</em>, to the destruction of the
elasticity and rapidity of movement, with the self-reliance
and initiative which makes for <em>individualism</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>The spirit of the 60th stood out, and did much

<p class='c014'>In the autumn of 1878 the 2nd Battalion, commanded
in the absence of Lieutenant-Colonel J. J. Collins by
Major Cromer Ashburnham, was quartered at Meerut,
and formed part of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, under
<em>Lieutenant-General Sir Donald Stewart</em>, which, upon
the outbreak of the Afghan War, was directed upon
Kandahar.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a trying march of 440 miles (one day thirty
miles across the desert without a man falling out)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Kandahar was occupied without resistance on the
8th of January, 1879.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the following September there was a rising of
the Afghans at Kabul, and the British envoy and his
escort were massacred. An advance upon Kabul,
the necessary retort to such an outrage, was accordingly
made by two columns, and after severe fighting
Kabul was occupied by <em>Lieut.-General Sir Frederick
Roberts</em>.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>April 19th, 1880, AHMAD KHEL.</div>

<p class='c014'>On the 27th of March, 1880, <em>Sir Donald Stewart’s</em>
Division of 7250 men was directed to leave Kandahar
and march upon Kabul. On the 19th of April the
Afghan Army attacked the column on the march at
<span class='sc'>Ahmad Khel</span>, when, concealed in the khors and gorges
of the hills, a large body of Ghazies charged boldly
upon the flank of the first line. Carrying all before
them, the issue for a time seemed doubtful, but the
stubborn courage of the British column won the
day, and the formidable Ghazies after suffering great
loss, were totally defeated. The 2nd Battalion then
commanded by Collins, had the ill-fortune to be taking
its turn of rear and flank guard on this particular day,
but, on hearing the firing, at once hurried to the scene
in time to bear a leading part in retrieving the critical
situation and aid in turning what at the onset threatened
to be a serious reverse into a decisive victory. G Company,
however, under Lieut. Davidson,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> allotted to
the permanent duty of escort to <em>Sir Donald Stewart</em>,
played a prominent part in meeting the first sudden
onslaught of the Ghazies, and did much to stem the
rush which at the moment seemed likely to be overwhelming.
Continuing the march, the Battalion was
present at the surrender of Ghuznee, and at the fight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of Urzoo on the 23rd of April when the Afghans were
again defeated. The column finally reached Kabul on
the 28th of the same month, thus accomplishing a
notable march. It had covered 320 miles in thirty-five
days over a hostile, difficult, and almost unknown
country, fought two general actions, and captured a
fortress.</p>

<p class='c014'>In July Ayub Khan defeated a British force at
Maiwand, and besieged <em>General Primrose</em> in Kandahar.
The Battalion, already distinguished for its marching
powers and steady discipline, was selected to form part
of the Relief Force of 10,000 men, which left Kabul
under <em>Sir Frederick Roberts</em> on the 9th of August, and
reached Kandahar on the 31st. This march—by the
same route as that of <em>Sir Donald Stewart</em>, but at the
hottest time of the year—was effected in twenty-four
days, inclusive of halts, giving an average of 13·3 miles
per diem, or of 14·5 for the days of actual marching.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aug. 21st, 1880, KANDAHAR.</div>

<p class='c014'>On the 21st of August <em>Sir Frederick Roberts</em> had
notified in the orders of the day that the city of Kandahar
was completely invested, characteristically adding
that he “hoped Ayub Khan would remain there.”
This wish was duly realised, for the Afghan leader was
found in position for battle, and on the following day,
September the 1st, he was attacked in front and flank,
and completely routed; the whole of his guns and camp
(which had been left standing) were captured by the
victorious troops.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the 8th of September the 2nd Battalion left
Kandahar to take part in the Mari Expedition, which
lasted for two months and entailed much hard marching;
there was not, however, any fighting.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the termination of the campaign the Commander-in-Chief
in India published the following General Order:</p>

<p class='c019'>“The 2nd Battalion 60th Rifles has throughout the war
maintained its high reputation for efficiency. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>march from Kandahar to Kabul, at Ahmad Khel, in
the memorable march from Kabul to Kandahar, and the
subsequent expedition to the Mari country, the 60th
Rifles were remarkable for their discipline and marching
powers. In the operations above described the Regiment
marched 1000 miles in 100 days. No light feat anywhere,
but in such a country as Afghanistan it is one well worthy
of record in the annals of the British Army.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On the 8th of September Lieutenant-Colonel J. J.
Collins, who had commanded the Battalion throughout
the campaign, succumbed to fever while on his way
to India on sick leave.</p>

<p class='c014'>In addition to the war medal, a special bronze star
was given for the march from Kabul to Kandahar.
It is worthy of note that khaki was worn, and that this
was the first campaign in which the Regiment, since
it had become Rifles, had fought in any colour but
green.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<div class='sidenote'>1879–1884, 3rd BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>Special reference must here be made to the 3rd
Battalion, whose good fortune led it to take part in
no less than four campaigns in six years, and thus to
justify a claim to being called “the fighting Battalion.”
Raised in 1855 in Ireland, this Battalion had been
moved to Madras at the close of the Mutiny in 1857,
to Burma in 1862, back to Madras in 1865, and to
Aden in 1871, and thence to England in 1872. It
had not unnaturally suffered much disadvantage from
its long exile of fifteen years in the East, unrelieved
by the experience of active service. It was, therefore,
in a condition particularly to profit by the example
of Hawley and the 4th Battalion, which had begun
to be generally felt, and there can be no doubt
that it derived at this period an immense benefit in
efficiency and interior economy, not only from the
influence of Hawley and his system, but also from
the traditions and example of the 1st Battalion. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>new commanding officer, Pemberton,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and its second
in command, Northey,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> had both been trained under
Hawley, and many of its captains and junior officers,
as well as N.C.O.’s, had been promoted or transferred
from the 1st and 4th Battalions to the 3rd
on its return from India. These officers and men
brought with them into the Battalion the vigorous spirit
of the Regiment, its flexible drill and tactics, its ideals
of rapidity and elasticity of movement, rendered
possible by the most careful attention to detail; its
extreme steadiness in close formations; and, above
all, that assiduous care for the comfort and well-being
of the rank and file, which is its great feature. In
consequence, the rapidity and smartness of manœuvre,
the strong self-reliance and individuality of the Riflemen,
and the excellent feeling existing between officers
and men were conspicuously the attributes of the
rejuvenated 3rd Battalion. The Battalion, therefore,
not only won for itself a great reputation as a fighting
unit, but conveyed later the same spirit to the Mounted
Infantry, for the inception and success of which its
officers and Riflemen were largely responsible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1879, SOUTH AFRICA ZULU WAR.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>April 2nd, 1879, GINGIHLOVO.</div>

<p class='c014'>Having been quartered for several years at Aldershot,
where it gained much credit, the Battalion was at
Colchester in January, 1879, when it received sudden
orders to embark for South Africa in consequence of
the defeat of <em>Lord Chelmsford’s</em> troops by Cetewayo,
the Zulu King, at the battle of Insandlwana. It
landed at Durban, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Leigh-Pemberton, and marched direct to the Tugela,
where, under <em>Lord Chelmsford</em> himself, it formed part
of the column to relieve Fort Pierson. Leaving the
Tugela on the 25th of March, it took a distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>part in the battle of Gingihlovo on the 2nd of April,
when the Zulu impis with a splendid gallantry charged
up to the muzzles of the men’s rifles, and severely tried
the young soldiers of whom the ranks were largely
composed. After a short half hour’s hard fighting the
Zulu army reluctantly withdrew, leaving an immense
number of killed and wounded behind them. The
casualties were light, but the Battalion sustained a
great loss in the death of Major and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel
Frank Northey, who was mortally wounded
early in the action.</p>

<p class='c014'>In June the Battalion was engaged in the second
advance to Ulundi under <em>Sir Garnet Wolseley</em>; and in
the subsequent pursuit and capture of Cetewayo,
which brought the Zulu War to a close, two companies
of the Battalion, under Captain Astley Terry,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> had
a prominent share.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1881, BOER WAR.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Jan. 28th, 1881, LAING’S NEK.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 3rd Battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cromer
Ashburnham,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> remained in South Africa, and was quartered
at Pietermaritzburg, when in January, 1881, the
Boers, under Joubert, invaded Natal. <em>Major-General Sir
George Colley</em>, the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief,
having assembled at Newcastle a small force,
which included the 3rd Battalion, advanced and attacked
the Boers on the 28th in position at Laing’s Nek. The
Battalion in part covered the left flank, and in part
formed a reserve to the assaulting column. The attack
was repulsed with heavy loss, and the Battalion covered
the retreat, but did not lose many men.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the 25th of January the 2nd Battalion arrived
from India in a state of the highest efficiency after
its successful experience in the Afghan War. Landing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>at Durban, it marched forthwith to join headquarters
at Newcastle, where it remained until the armistice
in March.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Feb. 8th, 1881, INGOGO FIGHT.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Boers, as a result of their victory at Laing’s
Nek, made a desperate effort to sever the communications
between <em>Colley’s</em> force at Mount Prospect, and the
advanced base at Newcastle. The General accordingly
took prompt steps to avert this catastrophe, and thus
it came about that on the 8th of February was fought
on the Ingogo Heights an action as glorious as any
in the history of the 60th. <em>Colley</em>, with two 9–pounder
R.A. guns, thirty-eight men of the Mounted Infantry,
and five companies of the 3rd Battalion, under
Ashburnham, marched early on the 8th from Prospect
upon Newcastle, crossed the Ingogo River, and, on
ascending the heights beyond, was attacked from all
sides shortly before noon. The British position was a
plateau covered with short grass, rocks, and boulders;
whereas the kloofs and slopes occupied by the Boers
were also not only strewn with rocks, but overgrown with
long grass, which being three and four feet high afforded
excellent cover. The troops, though completely surrounded,
maintained the fight for nearly seven hours,
until at last, in the gloom of approaching night and
a heavy thunderstorm, the fire ceased and the enemy
sullenly withdrew.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Battalion had lost five out of thirteen officers,
and 119 out of 295 other ranks; of I Company only
one officer and thirteen men were left, but nowhere
had the enemy gained ground. The survivors, without
food or water, and with ammunition running short,
but with courage and discipline still unshaken, then
faced the last ordeal of that long day. Little could be
done for the wounded, except to collect and leave them
with the chaplain, the doctor, and a few other noncombatants;
and then, in drenching rain and darkness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>only broken by flashes of lightning, the few remaining
horses were hooked into the guns, and the little force
moved silently across the veldt to the river, which was
in flood, and had to be forded breast high. So slippery
was the ground from the rain that the horses could not
draw the guns; this for the last few miles was done by
the Riflemen. At 8.30 a.m. the following morning
Prospect Camp was reached after a peculiarly strenuous
test of the courage and endurance of the troops.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The conduct of all ranks throughout this trying
day was admirable,” wrote <em>Sir George Colley</em> in his
despatch.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> “The comparatively young soldiers of the
60th Rifles behaved with the steadiness and coolness
of veterans. At all times perfectly in hand, they
held or changed their ground as directed without
hurry or confusion; though under heavy fire, themselves
fired steadily, husbanding their ammunition,
and at the end of the day, with sadly reduced numbers,
formed and moved off the ground with the most
perfect steadiness and order; and, finally, after
eighteen hours of continuous fatigue, readily and
cheerfully attached themselves to the guns, and
dragged them up the long hill from the Ingogo, when
the horses were unable to do so.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Feb. 27th, 1881, MAJUBA.</div>

<p class='c014'>On the night of the 26th of February <em>Sir George
Colley</em> decided to seize Majuba Hill by a night march—a
hazardous undertaking which was ably executed.
The following day the Boers in three assaulting columns,
covered by the rifle fire of their largely superior force,
carried the mountain with splendid gallantry, and
completely defeated the small British force of 414
soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two companies of the 3rd Battalion were posted
upon the lower spurs of the mountain, and with a third
company sent out later with ammunition they covered
the retreat, but were only slightly engaged.</p>

<p class='c014'>The brave and accomplished <em>Colley</em>—dauntless to
the end—died a soldier’s death upon the summit of
the mountain, and deplorable indeed was the loss in
officers and men of the force engaged. A peace—insisted
upon by the British Government—brought
this unhappy campaign to a close little to the satisfaction
of the troops concerned.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The 3rd Battalion, under Colonel Ashburnham,
had been moved from South Africa to Malta, when
the outbreak of hostilities in Egypt caused it to be
despatched with the 38th Regiment to Cyprus and
Alexandria in July, 1882.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1882, EGYPT.</div>

<p class='c014'>On the 18th of July, shortly after the bombardment
of Alexandria, it landed while the city was still
in flames, and formed part of the advanced force under
<em>Major-General Sir Archibald Alison</em>. A portion of
the Battalion took part with the Mounted Infantry,
on the 22nd of July, in the first engagement of the
campaign at Mallaha Junction, eight miles from Alexandria,
and again in the reconnaissance in force on
the 5th August near Ramleh.</p>

<p class='c014'>On August the 18th, upon the arrival of <em>Sir Garnet
Wolseley</em>, it embarked for Ismailia, and took part in
the actions of Tel-el-Mahuta on the 25th, and Kassassin
on the 9th of September, when the enemy, about
13,000 strong, was completely defeated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sept. 13th, 1882, TEL-EL-KEBIR.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Battalion, temporarily commanded by Major
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Ogilvy,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a> formed part of the 4th Brigade under Colonel
Ashburnham, which had been organised for the night
march of the 12th–13th September and the assault
of the lines of Tel-el-Kebir at daylight. The Brigade
forming the support of the Highland Brigade closed
up at the beginning of the battle as day began to dawn,
and gave a timely assistance in the assault of the
enemy’s lines. The Battalion in two lines pressed
eagerly forward with its accustomed dash, and entered
the Egyptian works at about the centre of the position,
where Major Cramer, second in Command, was wounded,
and had his horse shot under him. After an ebb
and flow of strenuous bayonet fighting the enemy
gave way on all sides, and, suffering great losses, were
broken and dispersed in headlong flight. Two days
later Cairo was captured, and the war ended, upon
which the Battalion formed part of the army of
occupation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1884, EL TEB, TAMAI.</div>

<p class='c014'>In February, 1884, the Battalion, under Ashburnham,
was ordered to Suakim, where it served in a
Brigade under that distinguished Rifleman, Major-General
Sir Redvers Buller,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a> as part of <em>General Sir
Gerald Graham’s</em> force. On the 29th of February it
took part in the defeat of the Dervishes at El Teb, and
on the 13th of March it was present at the critical battle
of Tamai. The troops were in two squares, one under
<em>Sir Gerald Graham</em>, commanding the force, the other
under Buller. <em>Graham’s</em> square was broken, and in
the confusion some of its men poured a volley into
Buller’s, causing one face to run in. Sir Redvers at
once rode outside the square, and, with great coolness,
rallied his men. By restoring the formation he undoubtedly
staved off a terrible disaster, for, had the
square been really broken, nothing could have saved
the army. This action ended the Campaign.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MOUNTED INFANTRY.</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The history of the 3rd Battalion at this period
would not be complete without reference to the introduction
of Mounted Infantry into the British Army.
It may be fairly said that the creation of Mounted
Infantry, the establishment of a recognised system
for its training, and the development of its tactics, is
largely the work of Officers and Riflemen of the 60th,
and in a very special degree of the 3rd Battalion.</p>

<p class='c014'>The value of Mounted Infantry under modern
conditions of war was established by the phenomenal
success of the relatively small force of Mounted Infantry
in Egypt in 1882. This corps, raised and organised
by an officer of the 60th,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> owed much of its success
to the officers and men drawn from the 3rd Battalion
who had similarly served in the Boer war; its high
reputation for individual gallantry and initiative was
universally acknowledged, and there was no engagement
in the war, from the preliminary skirmishes
before Alexandria in July, until the capture, by a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>, of the citadel of Cairo at mid-night of
the 14th–15th September, in which the Mounted
Infantry did not take a distinguished share.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>1884–85, NILE EXPEDITION.</div>

<p class='c014'>At Cairo, early in 1884, the inception and scheme
of organisation for the Mounted Camel Regiments was
also the work of an officer of the 60th Rifles. The
Mounted Infantry Camel Regiment in particular which
rendered such distinguished service with the Desert
Column, under the late <em>General Sir Herbert Stewart</em>,
was raised and equipped by the same officer, and was
largely composed of officers and men of the 60th. Two
out of the four companies were commanded by officers
of the 60th (Fetherstonhaugh<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> and Berkeley Pigott,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>both of whom had served with the 3rd Battalion in
South Africa), and six out of the sixteen subaltern
company officers were also Riflemen.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>In June, 1886, a comprehensive scheme for raising
and training Mounted Infantry in England was first
proposed, before a public audience, by an officer of the
60th, under the powerful wing of <em>Lord Wolseley</em>, and
in November of the same year Mounted Infantry were
raised and trained under Captain Lewis Butler at
Shorncliffe from detachments of the 2nd Battalion
and other regiments, under the effective supervision
of <em>Colonel Sir Baker Russell</em>.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>When, in 1887, it was subsequently decided to form
a regiment of Mounted Infantry for service with the
Cavalry Division, composed of detachments from nearly
all infantry battalions on home service, the command
and organisation was again given to an officer of the
60th, and, out of the eight companies composing the
original regiment, the 60th and Rifle Brigade found
two, or one-fourth of the whole corps. The Mounted
Infantry movement therefore may be said to owe its
inception, and in a large measure its success, to the
officers of the 60th, and to their riflemen.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Mounted Infantry system thus begun was
largely developed, so that upon the outbreak of the
South African war in 1899 there were many thousands
of officers and men throughout the infantry of the
Army who had been trained as Mounted Infantry.
It has been rightly said<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> that the ultimately successful
issue of the late campaign was in a great measure due
to “the large number of Mounted Infantry officers
previously trained, and to the long work of preparation
carried on before the war by the Mounted Infantry
enthusiasts.” If this is so, The King’s Royal Rifle
Corps may lay a fair claim to a goodly share of such
an important result.</p>

left India, and embarked on the Royal Indian Marine

from the bows.... At 4.20 a.m. the position of
the vessel appeared so critical that he at once ordered
the disembarkation of the men to cease, and the
women, children, and sick to be passed out. This
order was promptly carried out; the men clung to the
side as they stood (the ship lurching and bumping
heavily), and passed out the women and children
through; no man murmuring or moving from his
post.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>At 4.35 a.m., as the ship was in imminent danger
of heeling over and sinking, it became necessary to
expedite the landing. Owing to the “remarkable
courage and exemplary discipline” displayed, the whole
ship’s company, except two natives, were safely passed
on to the rocks and saved. “Lieutenant-Colonel
Forestier-Walker,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a> who was in command, was the
last soldier to leave the ship.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Commander-in-Chief,”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> ends the Special
Army Order of March the 13th, 1897, by declaring
that he “is proud of the behaviour of the troops during
this trying time. He regards it as a good example
of the advantages of subordination and strict discipline,
for it was by that alone, under God’s Providence, that
heavy loss of life was prevented.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Regiment will always cherish the honoured
memory of Colonel Forestier-Walker and of their
comrades, who were thus given the opportunity of
supplying one of the finest examples of high discipline,
which the annals of the British Army can show.</p>

<p class='c021'>Note.—As the following section deals with contemporaneous
events and with members of the Regiment still serving, it has been
considered advisable to adopt a simple form of record of events by
Battalions and units, leaving to a future historian the compilation of
a complete narrative.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>First Battalion.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>1st BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>When, on October the 7th, 1899, war was declared
by President Kruger and the Boer Government, the
1st Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Robert Henry Gunning, was at Dundee, Natal,
with the exception of G Company, which was at Eshowe
in Zululand, and there remained until after the
following March.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Talana Hill (20th of October), the first battle
of the war, the Battalion greatly distinguished itself
in the attack of the Boer position, and took a leading
part in the complete defeat of the enemy.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Lieutenant-Colonel
Gunning was killed leading the assault, and
out of seventeen officers present, five were killed and
eight wounded, together with many N.C.O.’s and
Riflemen. Major W. Pitcairn Campbell<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a> thereupon
assumed command.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then came the retreat to Ladysmith by a forced
march under peculiarly trying circumstances, and on
the 30th October took place the battle of Lombard’s
Kop, which, indecisive in its effect, led to the investment
by the Boer Army. The four months <span class='sc'>Defence
of Ladysmith</span> was the result, the chief battle being
that of Waggon Hill on January the 6th, 1900.</p>

<p class='c014'>Up to March, 1900, the Battalion lost eight officers
and forty-three men killed, eight officers and 180 men
wounded, and eighty-one men who died in hospital.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the Relief of Ladysmith, on the 3rd of March,
the Battalion joined the 8th Brigade, 5th Division,
and was with Buller’s advance into the Transvaal,
taking part in the passage of the Biggarsberg in May,
the attacks on Botha’s Pass and Alleman’s Nek (8th
and 11th of June).</p>

<p class='c014'>In August the Battalion assisted in the capture of
Amersfoort and Ermelo, and was present at the battle
of Belfast (August the 27th), when the armies under
<em>Roberts</em> and Buller first joined forces, taking part in
the attack on Bergendal.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>It subsequently assisted in the occupation of
Lydenburg (6th of September), and at the fighting in
the Mauchberg (9th of September), and at Pilgrim’s
Rest (27th of September). On October the 16th, 1900,
the Battalion returned to Middelburg, where it was
continually engaged in minor operations until July,
1901, when it proceeded to Cape Colony. Here it
built the seventy miles of blockhouses between De
Aar and Orange River, which it occupied till the end
of the war in June, 1902.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Second Battalion.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>2nd BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 2nd Battalion left India, and landed in Natal
in October, 1899, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
G. Grimwood, and proceeded at once to
Ladysmith, taking part in the battles of Rietfontein
(October the 24th) and Lombard’s Kop, in which it
fought alongside the 1st Battalion. It served through
the <span class='sc'>Defence of Ladysmith</span>, and greatly distinguished
itself in the famous fight on Waggon Hill of January
the 6th.</p>

<p class='c014'>Up to the 31st of March the Battalion lost five
officers (including two attached) and twenty-six men
killed in action, seventy-five men wounded, and 107
who died in hospital.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the relief it was under the command of Major
the Hon. E. J. Montagu-Stuart-Wortley,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and, with
the 1st Battalion, formed part of the 8th Brigade,
5th Division until the 1st of August, 1900, when it
proceeded to Ceylon in charge of prisoners of war.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Third Battalion.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>3rd BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 3rd Battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Robert George Buchanan-Riddell, left England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in November, 1899, with the 4th Light Infantry Brigade,
under Major-General the <em>Hon. N. G. Lyttelton</em>, and
landed at Durban on the 30th. It took part in all the
battles for the <span class='sc'>Relief of Ladysmith</span>, namely, Colenso
(December the 15th), Spion Kop (January the 24th),
Vaal Krantz (5th–7th of February), and the fourteen
days continuous fighting from the 13th to the 27th
of February, including the actions at Cingolo, Monte
Christo, Hlangwane, Hart’s Hill, and the final battle of
Pieter’s Hill, on February the 27th, Majuba Day. The
Battalion rightly cherishes with pride the names of
Spion Kop, Vaal Krantz, and Hart’s Hill. At Spion
Kop<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a> it captured by a bold and vigorous stroke the
famous Twin Peaks single-handed, rightly considered
one of the most notable feats of the war. Lieutenant-Colonel
Buchanan-Riddell was killed on the summit
at the moment of victory while leading his men, and
Major R. Bewicke-Copley<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a> thereupon assumed command.
At Vaal Krantz, after being engaged for
twenty-four hours, the Battalion highly distinguished
itself in repulsing the Boer counter-attack.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a> At Hart’s
Hill four companies were prominent in the desperate
struggle during the night of the 22nd–23rd of February,
delivering two bayonet charges and losing over a third
of their number in killed and wounded.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a> Part of the
Rifle Reserve Battalion was also engaged in this fight.
The Battalion lost during this portion of the campaign
three officers and forty-six men killed in action,
eleven officers and 195 men wounded, while fifty-nine
men died in hospital, and eight men were reported
missing.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is worthy of remark that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
Battalions met in the streets of Ladysmith on 3rd of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>March, 1900, when Sir Redvers Buller entered the
town at the head of his army.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the relief of Ladysmith, the 3rd Battalion
with the Light Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Division
took part in the advance through Northern Natal, in
the passage of the Biggarsberg, and in the attacks
on Botha Pass and Alleman’s Nek, 8th–11th June.
It entered Heidelberg at the end of June, 1900,
and from that date until the end of October it was
engaged in the neighbourhood of Standerton and
Greylingstad protecting the railway. In November,
1900, Lieutenant-Colonel Bewicke-Copley was selected
for command of a mobile column, which, till November
the 19th, included his own 3rd Battalion. The Battalion
subsequently occupied a line of blockhouses between
Machadodorp and Dalmanutha, Eastern Transvaal, till
the end of the war.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Fourth Battalion.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>4th BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 4th Battalion was quartered at Cork during the
earlier phases of the war, and was engaged in training
and sending out reinforcements to a large extent of
Mounted Infantry. It was not until December, 1901,
that the Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
E. W. Herbert,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> sailed to Africa. Landing at
Durban, it proceeded to Harrismith, O.R.C., where it
constructed and occupied a line of blockhouses running
west, and remained there until the conclusion of peace
in June, 1902.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Rifle Reserve Battalion.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>RIFLE RESERVE BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Reserve Battalion, under the command of
Major the Hon. E. J. Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, was
organised at Pieter-Maritzberg, and composed of officers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and reservists of The King’s Royal Rifle Corps and of
The Rifle Brigade, who were intended to re-inforce
the battalions shut up in Ladysmith. It joined the
11th Brigade at Chieveley, Natal, in January, 1900,
and took part in the operations of the 13th to the
27th of February, namely, Cingolo, Monte Christo,
Hlangwane, Hart’s Hill, and the final battle of Pieter’s
Hill. After the Relief of Ladysmith this improvised
Battalion was broken up, and the officers and men
of the Regiment were distributed between 1st and
2nd Battalions.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ninth Battalion.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>9th BATTALION (NORTH CORK MILITIA).</div>

<p class='c014'>This Militia Battalion of the Regiment, under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Cooke-Collis,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
volunteered for active service, and, their services having
been accepted, embarked for the seat of war in January,
1900. Landing at Cape Town on February 1st,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a> it
proceeded at once to Naauwpoort, and took part in
the operations round Colesburg. Leaving Naauwpoort
in March, the Battalion was employed protecting the
main line of communication and the reconstruction
of the railway through the Free State in rear of <em>Lord
Roberts</em>’ army. It eventually took charge of the line
between Vereeniging and Honing Spruit, where it
remained for a year, during which its section of the
line was never once cut by the enemy; this successful
result was in a large measure due to the good work
done by the company of Mounted Infantry raised
from the Battalion.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Battalion returned home in August, 1901, and
was disembodied.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Mounted Infantry of The King’s Royal Rifle Corps.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Note.—The Mounted Infantry raised in the Regiment having
played so distinguished a part in the campaign, it has been considered
advisable for purposes of historical reference to record their services
by battalions. The establishment of a Mounted Infantry Company
was 5 officers and 142 other ranks, organised into four sections.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1st BATT. M.I.</div>

<p class='c014'>A company was raised from the 1st Battalion in
South Africa before the war; it fought at Talana
Hill (October the 20th, 1899), was in the <span class='sc'>Defence
of Ladysmith</span>, and later with Buller’s army until it
arrived at Lydenburg in October, 1900. After this it
was continually engaged in the Eastern Transvaal,
until it joined the 25th Mounted Infantry in October,
1901 (<em>see below</em>). This Company lost twenty-five killed
and thirty-three wounded during the war.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2nd BATT. M.I.</div>

<p class='c014'>A Company was raised from the 2nd Battalion
upon its arrival in Natal, which was left outside
Ladysmith, and, joining Buller’s army on the Tugela,
took part in the campaign for the <span class='sc'>Relief of
Ladysmith</span> with <em>Dundonald’s</em> Mounted Troops. After
the relief this Company joined <em>Gough’s</em> Mounted
Infantry, and accompanied Buller’s army up to Lydenburg,
being subsequently engaged in the Eastern
Transvaal, Zululand, and the Orange River Colony
until the end of the war. The wastage in personnel
was such that only two officers and twenty-nine others
of the original company then remained, but the fact
that twenty per cent. of the original horses, received
in October, 1899, were still doing duty, constituted
a notable record in horse management.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>3rd BATT. M.I.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 3rd Battalion contributed one section to “The
Rifles’ Company” of the 1st M.I. (<cite>Vide 4th Battalion
M.I.</cite>).</p>

<p class='c014'>A second section, formed in December, 1899, fought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>with <em>Dundonald’s</em> mounted troops in the <span class='sc'>Relief of
Ladysmith</span>, subsequently joining <em>Gough’s</em> M.I. at Blood
River Poort, where it was severely handled and its
commander, Mildmay, was killed. This section, in
October, 1901, was united with a third section raised
in 1900, and joined the 25th M.I. in October, 1901
(<em>see below</em>), when the strength was raised to a full
company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>4th BATT. M.I.</div>

<p class='c014'>The 4th Battalion contributed a section to “The
Rifles’ Company,” under Captain Dewar, which,
together with the section of the 3rd Battalion, and
the two sections from the 3rd and 4th Battalions Rifle
Brigade, formed one of the four companies composing
the celebrated 1st M.I., organised and trained at Aldershot
under <em>Lieutenant-Colonel E. A. H. Alderson</em> before
the war. The “Rifles Company” was temporarily
detached, and, landing at Port Elizabeth in November,
1899, joined the force under <em>Major-General Sir William
Gatacre</em>, which was defeated at Stormberg on December
the 12th, where it was mentioned for its gallant conduct
in covering the retreat. The Company was then
attached to <em>French’s</em> Cavalry Division, and was at the
battle of Paardeburg, where Captain Dewar was
killed, and was also present at the surrender of Cronje
on the 27th of February, Majuba Day. It then rejoined
the 1st M.I.; and took part in the battles of
Poplar Grove and Driefontein, and the entry into
Bloemfontein (10th of March). It was at the surprise
of Broadwood’s Calvary Brigade at Sannah’s Post
(31st of March), where it behaved with conspicuous
gallantry, and it was at the relief of Wepener, and in
the fighting near Thabanchu.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 1st M.I. were then allotted to <em>Alderson’s</em> Brigade
with Hutton’s<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Mounted Troops, and took part in
<em>Lord Roberts’</em> advance upon Pretoria on the 2nd May.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The Company, therefore, was present in the actions
of Brandfort, Vet River, Sand River, Kroonstadt,
the Vaal River (27th of May), the battle of Doornkop,
near Johannesburg (28th–29th of May), the actions
at Kalkhoevel Defile, Six Mile Spruit (4th of June),
and the entry into Pretoria (5th of June). It was
similarly engaged at the battle of Diamond Hill (11th
of June); in the fighting south-east of Pretoria and
at the action of Rietvlei (July the 16th); in the
advance to and operations round Middelburg; in the
battle of Belfast (24th of August, 1900); and in the
march east from Dalmanutha, including the assault
of the almost impregnable position of Kaapsche Hoop
during the night of the 12th–13th of September.</p>

<p class='c014'>From this time till the end of the war this
Company was continually marching and fighting in
the Orange River Colony and Cape Colony, pursuing
De Wet, back again in the Transvaal, in countless
forays and skirmishes, in the saddle night and day.
When peace was declared it was at Vereeniging,
whence it marched to Harrismith, and was absorbed
into the Rifle Battalion of M.I. formed at that place.</p>

<p class='c014'>The 4th Battalion also sent out two complete companies
from Cork early in 1901, which were employed
in the Transvaal, and subsequently joined the 25th
M.I. in October of that year (<em>see below</em>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>25th (THE KING’S ROYAL RIFLE CORPS) MOUNTED INFANTRY BATTALION.</div>

<p class='c014'>On October the 18th, 1901, a complete Battalion
of Mounted Infantry<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a> was formed from the Regiment—an
unique distinction—and consisted of:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No. 1 Company 1st Battalion.</div>
      <div class='line'>No. 2 Company 4th Battalion.</div>
      <div class='line'>No. 3 Company 3rd Battalion.</div>
      <div class='line'>No. 4 Company 4th Battalion.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Battalion was concentrated at Middelburg in
the Transvaal, and was placed under the command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of Major C. L. E. Robertson-Eustace<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> until January,
1902, when he was succeeded by Major W. S. Kays.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The Battalion thus organised was composed of
officers and riflemen who had been in the field from
the beginning of the war, and were therefore tried
and experienced soldiers. It joined <em>Benson’s</em><a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> column
at Middelburg, a column of which it was said that
no Dutchman dared sleep within thirty miles of its
bivouac. The ceaseless activity and success of <em>Benson</em>
eventually decided Louis Botha, the Boer Commander-in-Chief,
to make a determined attempt to destroy
his force. To achieve this purpose he collected nearly
2000 men, and by a skilful combination of his troops
attacked the column while on the march near Bakenlaagte
upon the 30th of October. By a rapid charge
he overwhelmed the rear guard, captured two guns,
killed <em>Benson</em>, and surrounded the column, but was
eventually beaten off. The 25th M.I. fought with a
stubborn courage, and by their sturdy gallantry kept
the Boers at bay and gloriously upheld the traditions
of the Regiment, losing in the action eleven men killed,
five officers and forty-five men wounded.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus—stoutly fought out on both sides by mounted
troops of this especial type—ended a fight which has
been described as unique in the annals of war.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The
spirit of the Riflemen will best be understood from the
lips of one of the wounded in this gallant fight, who
remarked that “they were content if they had done
their duty, and felt rewarded if their Regiment thought
well of them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Mounted Infantry Battalion of the Regiment
ended its short but brilliant career by taking part in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>all the great “drives” in the E. Transvaal and N.E.
of the Orange Free State, and was finally at Greylingstad
when peace was declared on the 1st June, 1902.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Rifle Depot.</span></h4>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>RIFLE DEPOT.</div>

<p class='c014'>The Depot, under the command of Colonel Horatio
Mends, was at Gosport throughout the war. A
narrative of the work of the Regiment at this strenuous
period would not be complete without grateful reference
to the splendid service of administration, training,
and equipment, so devotedly performed by the Colonel
Commandant, his Staff, and the Company officers
generally of the Rifle Depot.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Adjutant was five times changed, but the
Quarter-Master, Major Riley,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> remained constant to
his difficult duties throughout the whole of this trying
ordeal.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is stated that 4470 recruits joined the Depot,
were trained, and passed to the various Battalions,
while many thousands of Reservists were mobilized,
equipped, clothed, and drafted for duty.</p>

<p class='c014'>The work of discharge at the end of the war was
not less severe, but there is no record of failure or of
breakdown, and the success of the admirable system
of administration was universally acknowledged.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The Rifle Depot was moved back to Winchester
on the 29th of March, 1903, after nine years of exile
at Gosport caused by the re-building of the Barracks
which had been destroyed by fire.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>PART IV.</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h3 class='c001'><span class='sc'>A Retrospect.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The preceding pages will have shown that the
Regiment from its inception has possessed certain
distinctive characteristics which are pre-eminently those
required for making Light Infantry and Riflemen of
the best type.</p>

<p class='c014'>Raised in 1755, the Regiment, inspired by the
genius of Henry Bouquet, early displayed that strong
individuality, that self-reliant courage, and that ready
initiative coupled with steady discipline, which won
from the intrepid Wolfe himself the proud motto of
<em>Celer et Audax</em>. In 1797, under the experienced command
of Baron de Rottenburg, the famous 5th Battalion
(Rifles) was raised as a special type of Light Troops.
Thus the 5th Battalion of the Regiment, the first Rifle
Corps of the British Army, revived those special qualities
of the Royal Americans which had rendered the Regiment
so renowned in its earlier years, and were destined
to win imperishable fame throughout the Peninsular
War.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a long interval of peace the Regiment from
1836 to 1854 received a similar impetus at the hands
of Molyneux and Dundas, and reaped a rich harvest
of lasting honour and glory upon the Delhi Ridge by
displaying the same supremely valuable characteristics
which had distinguished it in America and in Spain.
Again, from 1861–1873, under Hawley’s commanding
influence and inspiring skill, the Regiment, through
the 4th Battalion, opened up a more rapid and elastic
system of drill and tactics, a more intelligent treatment
of the soldier, and the betterment of his life in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>barracks, of which the good effects are felt to-day
not only in the Regiment but in the Army at large.
The qualities thus maintained for a century and a half,
have borne in later years abundant fruit, of which the
stubborn courage at the Ingogo fight, the calm discipline
of the <em>Warren Hastings</em>, the eager valour of Talana
Hill, and the impetuous assault up the slopes of the
Twin Peaks are glorious examples.</p>

<p class='c014'>To the same special qualities was due the inspiration
which created the Mounted Infantry as a portion
of the British Army, and it is to the officers and men
of the 60th that the inception and success of that powerful
arm is largely due.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let the Riflemen of to-day, who read the deeds
of their gallant comrades of the past, remember that
if they are to maintain the traditions and increase
still more the reputation of the famous Corps to
which they belong, it can only be by cultivating
the same spirit of ready self-sacrifice and unsparing
devotion to duty, and by developing the same prompt
initiative, steady discipline, and unflinching courage,
which have ever been the secret of the Regiment’s
success.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let each Rifleman also recollect that a distinguished
Past is rather a reproach than a glory unless maintained
by an equally distinguished Present, and developed, if
possible, by an even more distinguished future.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
